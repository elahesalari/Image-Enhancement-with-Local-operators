# Image Enhancement with Local Operators

Local operators, such as logarithmic and exponential transformations, can effectively enhance image quality by adjusting contrast and brightness.

---

## Overview

- Selected a diverse set of at least **10 images** containing dark, bright, and well-balanced exposures.  
- Applied suitable local operators (logarithmic or exponential) with varying rates to each image to enhance their visual quality.  
- Visualized the results by plotting all original and enhanced images in subplots for comparison.
